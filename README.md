# python_game
This is my first attempt trying to create a game in Python using a tutorial I found online.

I tried to recreate the first project in the video, which was a game called Pig. 
I did it to test Copilot for the first time.
The results seriously impressed me. It helped me to correct my code and offered many insights and suggestions while I was writing it - following the tutorial, of course. 
I don't think all the suggestions were great, however I suppose for someone who truly knows what they're doing Copilot can be really great. It really accelerates the process.
